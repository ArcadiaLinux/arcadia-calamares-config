# This example is rather limited. See `netinstall.conf` for full documentation
# on the configuration format. The module configuration file `netinstall.conf`
# **may** contain the package-list, but that is only useful for static
# package-lists. If you are updating the package lists or changing the package
# offerings, an online `netinstall.yaml` is the way to go; or you can put the
# `netinstall.yaml` on the installation media and modify that, while keeping
# your Calamares configuration constant.
#
# Which approach works depends on what you want to offer and how your
# ISO-image toolchain works.
